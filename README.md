# 📊 Analysis of Wages by Education in the U.S.A (1973–2022)

This project investigates the relationship between educational attainment and hourly wages in the United States using data from 1973 to 2022. We analyze wage trends, demographic impacts (gender, race, and ethnicity), and economic indicators to understand how education influences income over time.

## 📌 Project Motivation

As students navigating an evolving educational and economic landscape, we aim to answer:

- Does higher education truly lead to higher wages?
- How do gender and race intersect with education in influencing income?
- What economic or industry-related factors influence wage gaps?
- How have wages shifted across education levels over 50 years?

By addressing these questions, we hope to inform policy recommendations that support fair and equitable wage growth.
